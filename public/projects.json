It utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to analyze a dataset of 78,000 records, including attributes like department, education, experience, and performance metrics. The model improves decision-making by helping HR teams identify potential candidates for promotion. Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric, and necessary adjustments were made to reduce bias and improve generalization. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in HR analytics."
